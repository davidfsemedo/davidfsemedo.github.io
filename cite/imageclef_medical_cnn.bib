abstract = "This paper describes the NovaSearch team participation inthe ImageCLEF 2016 Medical Task in the subfigure classification subtask.Deep learning techniques have proved to be very effective in automaticrepresentation learning and classification tasks with general data. Morespecifically, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have surpassed humanlevelperformance in the ImageNET classification task, making them apromising model for the task of medical modality classification. We assesshow each model behave when dealing with medical images, by developingthree different models, with different depths and components, andanalyse the impact of these factors in the performance. One of the keyingredients for the effectiveness of CNNs (and deep learning in general)is the use of large amounts of data for training. This subtask scenariois completely different, due to the small size of the dataset, implying asignificant risk of overfitting. We apply state-of-the-art techniques developedto reduce overfitting in these networks to our models and evaluatetheir effectiveness. Our best model achieves 65.31{\%} accuracy on the testset using only the training data provided.",
