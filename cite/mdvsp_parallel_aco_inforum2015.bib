  abstract = {The Multi-Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem with Line Exchanges is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem arising in transit service companies. Due to the complexity of the problem and the large size of the search space, complete search cannot be used in order to guarantee optimality. Hence, we adopted the Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic. ACO can be improved using parallel computing. However, in order to maintain the semantics of the original ACO metaheuristic, parallelization strategies need to be synchronous, originating the straggler problem. We propose three shared-memory asynchronous parallelization strategies that break the original ACO algorithm semantics and differ essentially on the degree of concurrency allowed while manipulating the learned information. The results show that two of our asynchronous strategies outperform synchronous ones in terms of the speedup achieved and also solution quality. Additionally, the speedup increases as the level of concurrency allowed in asynchronous strategies increases, without sacrificing the quality of the solutions obtained. The proposed strategies effectiveness is validated through an analysis and discussion of the ACO convergence and scalability, in terms of search depth and number of threads used in a shared-memory architecture, with multi-core processors.
